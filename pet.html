            <h3>stay with West Highland White terrier</h3>
            <p>Originating from the West Highlands region of Scotland,the West Highland White Terrier is a cute and friendly dog with a white appearance. The West Highland White terrier is usually very friendly and displays a friendly and gentle attitude towards both humans and other animals. They are usually lively and full of energy, especially when we often run on the open grass, which brings me a lot of joy and vitality. Besides, it is very firm in its loyalty to its master and will always provide protection and warn us when we are in danger.</p>

                 <h3>Explore the world of Yorkshire</h3>
                 <p>Yorkshire Terriers are small, small dogs, they are brave, lively and loyal, and their small bodies are full of great energy. Yorkshire xiuxiu is my second dog and I always hold her a lot while watching TV because of their small size. He always likes to lick my fingers gently to make me give him more love. Getting along with it always relieves my stress and loneliness, and sits quietly beside me silently to accompany me when I am sad.It is not only a lovely pet, but also a loyal partner in our life.</p>
